    <h2>This lasagna recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</h2>
    <h2>Ingredients
        <ol>
            <li>Eggs: This Italian ricotta pie calls for a whopping 16 eggs (12 for the filling and four for the crust).
            </li>
            <li>Sugar: You'll need three cups of white sugar (two for the filling and one for the crust).</li>
            <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the ricotta filling and the sweet crust.</li>
            <li>Ricotta: The dense, creamy filling calls for three pounds of ricotta cheese.</li>
            <li>Chocolate: Semisweet chocolate chips take the decadent filling up a notch, but you can leave them out if
                you like.</li>
            <li>Flour: The sweet crust starts with four cups of all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>Baking powder: Baking powder guarantees a tender and flaky pie crust.</li>
            <li>Shortening: Shortening (instead of butter) makes the pie crust easy to roll out and it holds its shape
                well.</li>
            <li>Milk: Brush the pie crust with milk to give it a matte finish.</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Steps
        <ul>
            <li>Make the filling: Beat eggs, sugar, and vanilla together in a large bowl. Stir in ricotta cheese and
                chocolate chips; set aside.</li>
            <li>Make the crust: Combine flour, sugar, and baking powder together in a large bowl; cut in shortening
                until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in beaten eggs and vanilla. Divide dough into 4 balls, wrap
                in plastic, and chill for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch, deep-dish pie plates.</li>
            <li>Roll out two dough balls and line the bottom and sides of each prepared pie plate. Try not to make the
                crust too thick, as it will expand during cooking. Roll the remaining two dough balls out into 10-inch
                circles. Cut into 1/2-inch strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel.</li>
            <li>Pour ricotta filling evenly into pie crusts. Start with the longest strips of dough and lay the first 2
                in an X in the center of the pie. Alternate horizontal and vertical strips, weaving them in an
                over-and-under pattern. Use the shortest strips for the edges of the lattice. Fold the ends of the
                lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and flute the crust; brush lattice top with milk.
                Arrange foil on edges of crust.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 to 30 minutes; remove foil. Rotate pies on the rack so they will bake
                evenly. Continue to bake until a knife inserted in the center of each pie comes out clean, 25 to 30
                minutes more. Cool completely on wire racks. Refrigerate until serving.</li>
        </ul>
